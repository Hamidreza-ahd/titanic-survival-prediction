# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project aims to predict the survival of Titanic passengers using a dataset sourced from the Kaggle competition. The workflow covers:

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Data cleaning and preprocessing
* Feature engineering
* Scaling
* Model implementation and comparison

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUserName/titanic-project.git
   cd titanic-project
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   * Using **conda**:

     ```bash
     conda env create -f environment.yml
     conda activate titanic-env
     ```

   * Or using **pip**:

     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Launch Jupyter Lab/Notebook**

   ```bash
   jupyter lab
   # or
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. **Open the notebook**

   Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory and open `titanic_project.ipynb`.

## 🔍 Workflow Overview

1. **Define Objectives**
   Outline the problem and performance goals (accuracy, recall, etc.).

2. **Data Loading & Inspection**
   Load `train.csv` and `test.csv`. Review data dimensions, types, and missing values.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   Visualize distributions and relationships for features such as:

   * Age
   * Sex
   * Passenger Class (Pclass)
   * Family Size (SibSp + Parch)

4. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**

   * Handle missing values (mean, median, or mode imputation)
   * Encode categorical variables (e.g., Sex, Embarked)
   * Create new features if useful (e.g., Title extraction from Name)

5. **Feature Scaling**
   Normalize numeric features using `MinMaxScaler` or `StandardScaler`.

6. **Model Implementation**
   Train and evaluate the following classifiers:

   * Logistic Regression
   * Decision Tree
   * Random Forest
   * K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

7. **Model Comparison & Selection**
   Compare models using metrics:

   * Accuracy
   * Precision, Recall, F1-score
   * Confusion Matrix

8. **Generate Predictions**
   Use the best model to predict survival on the test set and prepare submission file.

## 📊 Results

* **Best model**: *Specify the top-performing algorithm*
* **Model accuracies:**

  * Logistic Regression: XX.X%
  * Decision Tree: XX.X%
  * Random Forest: XX.X%
  * KNN: XX.X%

Update these values after running the notebook.
